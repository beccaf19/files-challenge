			<p>Sherlock Holmes is a consulting dective based out of London. He is a fictional character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Holmes is famous for his astute logical reasoning, his ability to adopt almost any disguise, and his use of forensic science to solve difficult cases. Holmes's primary intellectual detection method is abductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning allows Holmes to impressively reveal a stranger's occupation, such as a Retired Sergeant of Marines in A Study in Scarlet; a former ship's carpenter turned pawnbroker in "The Red-Headed League"; and a billiard-marker and a retired artillery NCO in "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter".</p>
